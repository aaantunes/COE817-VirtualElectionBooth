# COE817-VirtualElectionBooth
COE817 Final Project

To run application, first run CTF.java followed by CLA.java, then you may run as many instances of Voter.java as youd like

If you wish to end the election and tally the votes, run a new instance of Voter.java and enter "exit" as the username.
Finally, Voter.java instances close after completion, however you must manually close CLA.java and CTF.java instances.
